\title{Find overlaps of TE loci regions with genomic features}
\usage{
.getHashOverlaps(x, ignore, gtffile)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A GRanges object of TE loci}

\item{gtffile}{Path to GTF file to create annotation from}

\item{stranded}{TRUE/FALSE should overlaps be computed with respect to strand}
}
\value{
List of hash vectors overlapping genomic features
}
\description{
Finds any TE that overlaps with an exon by transcript, and intron by
transcript, a 3 prime UTR by transcript, a 5 prime UTR by transcript, or
a promoter by gene.
